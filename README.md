# Bubble
A open-source discord bot for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) in TypeScript.

## Features
### Macros
Create macros that you can run with /use <name> that send message like socials, images, or memes. By default everyone can create one with the /macro command, but you can disable it's use in your integrations tab.
### Weather
Use the /weather command or type "weather (location)" in chat to see weather information.
### Quotes
React to any message with a ðŸ“Œ (`:pushpin`) to send it into a a "quotes" channel.
> This allows you to essentially bypass the 50 pin limit discord has.
### Petitions
Run the /petitions command to create a petition, or a poll, on something.
